# Sentiment-Analysis-MusicAlbumReviews
This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis on music album reviews using Python and the VADER sentiment analyzer from NLTK.

Problem Statement:
The goal is to analyze the sentiment (positive or negative) of music album reviews and visualize the distribution of sentiments across different ratings.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, nltk

Steps and Implementation:

Dataset Loading and Preparation:
The dataset (music_album_reviews.csv) is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
NaN values in the 'Review' column are filled with empty strings for data cleanliness.

Visualizing Rating Distribution:
A histogram is plotted to visualize the distribution of ratings across the dataset.
The count of each rating category is displayed for insights into the dataset.

Sentiment Analysis Using VADER:
VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) from NLTK is used for sentiment analysis.
Each review in the 'Review' column is analyzed for sentiment using VADER.
Sentiment is categorized as 'Positive', 'Negative', or 'Neutral' based on the compound score.

Adding Sentiment Labels:
A new column 'Sentiment' is added to the DataFrame to store the sentiment labels ('Positive', 'Negative', 'Neutral') for each review.

Visualizing Sentiment Distribution:
A bar chart is generated to visualize the distribution of 'Positive', 'Negative', and 'Neutral' sentiments across the dataset.

Running the Code:
Make sure Python and the required libraries (pandas, matplotlib, nltk) are installed.
Clone the repository or download the music_album_reviews.csv dataset.
Run the Python script music_album_sentiment_analysis.py.

Example Output:
The script will display the rating distribution histogram and the count of ratings.
It will print the DataFrame with the added 'Sentiment' column showing the sentiment analysis results.
A bar chart will visualize the distribution of 'Positive', 'Negative', and 'Neutral' sentiments.
Insights and Discussion
Insights gained from the sentiment analysis can provide an overview of the overall sentiment towards different music albums.
The visualization helps in understanding how sentiments vary across different ratings and albums.

Possible further improvements you can make:
Expand sentiment analysis techniques to include machine learning-based approaches for more "sophisticated" analysis.
Enhance visualization with interactive charts or additional statistical insights.
